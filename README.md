## Overview
Welcome to the SQL Murder Mystery Project! This project is designed to help you practice your SQL skills in a fun and engaging way by solving a murder mystery using SQL queries.

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

In this murder mystery, you'll step into the shoes of a detective who needs to analyze a database to solve a crime. As you progress through the mystery, you'll write SQL queries to extract relevant information from the database and piece together clues to identify the culprit.

## Getting Started
To get started with the SQL Murder Mystery Project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Database**: Download the SQL database file (`murder-mystery.db`) provided with this project. This file contains the database schema and data necessary to solve the mystery.

2. **Set Up Your Environment**: Make sure you have a SQL database management system installed on your machine. You can use SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other SQL-compatible database system.

3. **Import the Database**: Use your SQL database management system to import the `murder-mystery.db` file. Refer to the documentation of your specific database system for instructions on how to import a database.

4. **Start Solving the Mystery**: Once the database is imported, you can start solving the murder mystery! Write SQL queries to explore the database, extract relevant information, and uncover clues that will help you identify the culprit.

## Rules of the Game
- Use SQL queries to analyze the data and solve the murder mystery.
- Document your progress and findings as you progress through the investigation.
- Be creative and thorough in your analysis. The more you explore the data, the more likely you are to uncover valuable clues.
